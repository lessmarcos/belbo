BELBO

---------------

Belbo is a not production-ready static site generator that so far suits
my needs (basic front-matter handling, basic layout templating and
basic markdown to html processing). If there is something remarkable is that
it enables what I call *parallel blogs* (read more about it here
https://lessmarcos.com/posts/2020/08/parallel-blogs/).

USAGE

Install it via:
    go install github.com/lessmarcos/belbo

The binary (belbo) is installed in your $GOPATH/bin directory. Run it as:

    me@localhost:~/my-blog$ belbo
