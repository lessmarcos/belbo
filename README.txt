BELBO

---------------

Belbo is a not production-ready static site generator that suits
my simplistic needs (basic front-matter handling, basic layout templating and
basic markdown to html processing). If there is something remarkable is that
it enables what I call *parallel blogs* (read more about it here
https://lessmarcos.com/posts/2020/08/parallel-blogs/).
