BELBO

---------------

A toy static site generator. Not ready for production, but it fulfills some basic needs:
front-matter handling, layout templating and markdown to html processing. If there is something
remarkable is that it enables what I call *parablogs* (read more about it here
https://lessmarcos.com/posts/2020/08/parallel-blogs/).

USAGE

Install it via:
    go get -u github.com/lessmarcos/belbo/...

The binary (belbo) is installed in your $GOPATH/bin directory. Use it:

    me@localhost:~/my-blog$ belbo
